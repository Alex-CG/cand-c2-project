New Budget 6500 USD monthly:

 - I think we could only use 6 web servers and they should be reserved instances for 1 year.
 - We could use only  6 app servers (this will also reduce the ELBs costs since we will be balacing less servers)
 - For the database we might be OK with only having 8 vCPU and 32GB RAM for the primary DB and less for the replica DB since it is only a read replica (8 vCPU & 16GB RAM).
